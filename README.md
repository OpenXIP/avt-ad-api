Welcome to the AVT Annotation Database API&trade; Project!
==========================================================

The Algorithm Validation Toolkit&trade; (AVT&trade;) Open Source project is a set
of tools that facilitate the testing and statistical comparison of image processing
algorithms.  It is built upon the
[eXtensible Imaging Platform&trade; (XIP&trade;)](http://www.OpenXIP.org) development
framework, and can create and consume objects based
on [AIM (Annotation and Image Markup] (https://github.com/NCIP/annotation-and-image-markup)
models.  

The Annotation Database API&trade; component of AVT&trade; defines the Application Programming 
Interface utilized by other AVT components and the
[XIP Host&trade;](https://github.com/OpenXIP/xip-host) to access the Annotation Database.  

The ultimate goals of the project include:

* Provide a stable API despite underlying changes to the actual AD implementation.
* Allow swapping of the underlying AD implementation without changes to the calling application.
